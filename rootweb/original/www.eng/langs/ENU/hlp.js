You should see the USB device that is connected to your router. By default, all the contents of the USB device are accessible. You can create a new share that is limited to any subset of the contents with the security level you specify.<br/>Step 4: The first time you use ReadySHARE Cloud, you are asked to download a Windows client, which is used to make a secure connection from your PC to the router's USB device. Log into this client and you can access the USB device from anywhere.<br/>Currently you can only download the Windows OS client. The Mac OS client will be ready at a later time on the website.<br/> <b>Note:</b> Without this client, you can only browse your USB device contents by clicking the '+' icon (Add Share) on the website. You won't be able to open files or make changes to them. </p><p><b>User Name and Password</b></p><p>This is the ReadySHARE Cloud account you created on NETGEAR website in step 1.<br/> The router with USB storage will only show up after you register it.
